# pizza-sales-dashboards
firstly i derive all the KPI using sql query then
load data in power BI by connecting sql server then 
clean the data  and modify the data to be useful in visulaization then
calulate the required measure then
make the two dashboards first one is home or main dashbaords and 
second one is best and worst pizza seller in terms of revenue or quantity then
connect the two dashbaords using navigator button and sync the both dashboards with slicer.
